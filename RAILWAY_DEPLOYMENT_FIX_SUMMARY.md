# Railway Deployment Fix - URGENT SYNTAX ERROR RESOLVED

## 🚨 Issue Identified and Fixed

**Problem**: Railway deployment was crashing due to a syntax error in `main.py` at line 684
**Error**: `SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block`
**Root Cause**: Incomplete try-except block structure with two consecutive `except Exception as e:` blocks

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Syntax Error Resolution
- **Fixed incomplete try-except blocks** in main.py
- **Separated user profile router** into proper try-catch structure
- **Added proper fallback handling** for both routers
- **Maintained all enhanced AI functionality**

### Code Changes Made
```python
# BEFORE (Broken):
try:
    # simple analysis router code
try:  # <- Missing except block
    # user profile router code
except Exception as e:  # <- First except
    # user profile fallback
except Exception as e:  # <- Second except (SYNTAX ERROR)
    # simple analysis fallback

# AFTER (Fixed):
try:
    # simple analysis router code
except Exception as e:
    # simple analysis fallback

try:
    # user profile router code  
except Exception as e:
    # user profile fallback
```

2. **Test Health Endpoint**: `GET https://web-production-de0bc.up.railway.app/health`
3. **Verify API Status**: `GET https://web-production-de0bc.up.railway.app/version`

### Expected Response (Health Check)
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-29T10:15:00Z",
  "components": {
    "user_profile": {"status": "loaded", "healthy": true},
    "simple_analysis": {"status": "loaded", "healthy": true},
    "market_context": {"status": "loaded", "healthy": true}
  },
  "message": "All systems operational"
}
```

### Test Enhanced AI Features
```bash
# Test User Profile API
curl -X GET "https://web-production-de0bc.up.railway.app/api/user/investment-profile/" \
  -H "X-User-ID: test_user"

# Test Enhanced AI Analysis
curl -X POST "https://web-production-de0bc.up.railway.app/api/ai/simple-analysis/portfolio" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-User-ID: test_user" \
  -d '{"total_value": 1000000, "holdings": []}'
```

## 🎉 Success Metrics

### Deployment Success Indicators
