- Trading halt detection and recommendations
- Market session tracking (pre-market, regular hours, after-hours)
- Advanced analytics with 6-level volatility classification
- Comprehensive error handling and performance monitoring

🌐 API Endpoints:
- Market Data: /api/trading-engine/market-data/* (7 endpoints)
- Market Conditions: /api/trading-engine/market-condition/* (10 endpoints)
- System Health: Built-in monitoring and metrics

🧪 Testing:
- Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate
- Performance benchmarks: 50 symbols processed simultaneously
- Deployment verification scripts included
- All components tested and validated

📚 Documentation:
- Complete implementation guides for all components
- Frontend integration documentation
- Deployment and troubleshooting guides
- API endpoint documentation

🎯 Production Ready:
