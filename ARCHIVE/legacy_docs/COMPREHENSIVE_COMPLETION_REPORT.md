   - Railway automatically deployed updates
   - Comprehensive testing validates functionality

### 🗄️ Database Status
**Before**: Critical errors preventing functionality
```
ERROR - no such table: users
ERROR - no such table: portfolio_snapshots
```

**After**: Fully functional database layer
```
✅ Users table: Working
✅ Portfolio snapshots table: Working
✅ Automatic initialization: Active
```

### 🌐 API Endpoint Status
**Before**: Missing endpoints causing 404/405 errors
```
404 Not Found - GET /api/trading/status
405 Method Not Allowed - GET /api/broker/session
403 Forbidden - AI endpoints
```

**After**: All endpoints functional
```
✅ Trading Status: 200 OK
✅ Broker Session: 200 OK  
✅ AI Endpoints: Accessible
```
