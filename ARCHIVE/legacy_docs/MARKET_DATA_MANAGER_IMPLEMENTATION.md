    async def stop() -> None
    
    async def subscribe_to_symbol(symbol: str, subscriber_id: str, callback: Callable) -> bool
    async def unsubscribe_from_symbol(symbol: str, subscriber_id: str) -> bool
    
    async def get_current_price(symbol: str) -> Optional[PriceUpdate]
    async def get_market_status() -> Dict[str, Any]
    
    async def handle_price_update(price_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool
```

### Data Structures

```python
@dataclass
class PriceUpdate:
    symbol: str
    price: float
    bid: float
    ask: float
    volume: int
    timestamp: datetime
    change: float = 0.0
    change_percent: float = 0.0
    high: float = 0.0
    low: float = 0.0
    open_price: float = 0.0

@dataclass
class MarketDataSubscription:
    symbol: str
    subscriber_id: str
    callback: Callable[[PriceUpdate], None]
    created_at: datetime
    last_update: Optional[datetime] = None
    is_active: bool = True
```
