./deploy_backend_update.sh
```

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update automated trading engine backend"

# Push to repository
git push origin main

# Railway automatically deploys changes
# Monitor at: https://railway.app
```

### Deployment Verification
```bash
# Run integration tests
python3 test_integration_simple.py

# Check specific endpoints
curl https://quantum-leap-backend-production.up.railway.app/health
```
