## 🧠 **How AI Intelligence is Built Over Time**

### **Data Storage & Learning Architecture:**

#### **1. Portfolio Data Storage**
```
📁 Database Structure:
/user_portfolios/
  ├── holdings_history/          # Your positions over time
  ├── performance_metrics/       # P&L, returns, risk metrics  
  ├── ai_analysis_results/       # All AI recommendations
  ├── user_preferences/          # Your trading patterns
  └── market_context/            # Market conditions during analysis
```

#### **2. AI Learning Process**
```
🔄 Intelligence Building Cycle:

1. Data Collection:
