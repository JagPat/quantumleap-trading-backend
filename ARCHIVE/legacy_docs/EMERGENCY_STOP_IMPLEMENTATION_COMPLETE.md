1. **EmergencyStopSystem** (`app/trading_engine/emergency_stop.py`)
   - Main emergency stop orchestration system
   - Handles different scopes: USER, STRATEGY, SYMBOL, SYSTEM
   - Concurrent order cancellation and strategy pausing
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging

2. **API Endpoints** (`app/trading_engine/emergency_stop_router.py`)
   - RESTful API for emergency stop operations
   - Panic button functionality
   - Strategy-specific emergency stops
   - History and status tracking

3. **Event Integration**
   - Integrated with existing event bus system
   - Emergency stop events with CRITICAL priority
   - Event-driven emergency stop triggers

4. **Data Models**
   - EmergencyStopRequest: Request structure
   - EmergencyStopResult: Execution results
   - EmergencyStopReason: Categorized reasons
   - EmergencyStopScope: Different stop scopes

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multiple Emergency Stop Scopes
- **USER**: Stop all trading activity for a user
- **STRATEGY**: Stop specific strategy only
- **SYMBOL**: Stop trading for specific symbol
- **SYSTEM**: System-wide emergency stop

### 2. Comprehensive Actions
- ✅ Cancel all active orders immediately
- ✅ Pause all active strategies
- ✅ Close all positions (optional)
- ✅ Concurrent execution for speed
- ✅ Detailed execution tracking

### 3. Multiple Trigger Reasons
- **USER_INITIATED**: Manual user action
- **RISK_VIOLATION**: Automatic risk-based trigger
- **SYSTEM_ERROR**: System failure response
- **MARKET_CONDITION**: Market volatility response
- **CONNECTIVITY_ISSUE**: Network/broker issues
- **REGULATORY_HALT**: Regulatory compliance

### 4. API Endpoints

#### POST `/api/trading-engine/emergency-stop/execute`
Execute emergency stop with custom parameters
```json
{
  "reason": "Risk violation detected",
  "scope": "USER",
  "cancel_orders": true,
  "pause_strategies": true,
  "close_positions": false
}
```

#### POST `/api/trading-engine/emergency-stop/panic`
Panic button - immediate stop with position closure
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "orders_cancelled": 5,
  "strategies_paused": 3,
  "positions_closed": 2,
  "execution_time_ms": 150.5
}
```

#### POST `/api/trading-engine/emergency-stop/strategy/{strategy_id}/stop`
Stop specific strategy
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Strategy emergency stop executed"
}
```

#### GET `/api/trading-engine/emergency-stop/history`
Get emergency stop history
```json
{
  "history": [
    {
      "user_id": "user123",
      "reason": "USER_INITIATED",
      "success": true,
      "orders_cancelled": 3,
      "execution_time_ms": 125.0
    }
  ]
}
```

#### GET `/api/trading-engine/emergency-stop/status`
Get system status and statistics
```json
{
  "system_status": "operational",
  "total_emergency_stops": 15,
  "success_rate": 98.5,
  "active_stops": 0
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Concurrent Execution
```python
# Cancel orders concurrently for speed
cancel_tasks = []
for order in active_orders:
    task = asyncio.create_task(order_service.cancel_order(order['id'], user_id))
    cancel_tasks.append(task)

results = await asyncio.gather(*cancel_tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation on partial failures
- Detailed error logging and reporting
- Retry logic for critical operations
- Comprehensive exception handling

### Performance Optimization
- Sub-second execution times
- Concurrent operations
- Efficient database queries
- Minimal memory footprint

### Event Integration
```python
# Publish emergency stop event
await publish_emergency_stop(user_id, "Risk violation detected")

# Event handler automatically processes the stop
class EmergencyStopHandler(EventHandler):
    async def handle_event(self, event: TradingEvent) -> bool:
        await self.stop_system.execute_emergency_stop(request)
```
