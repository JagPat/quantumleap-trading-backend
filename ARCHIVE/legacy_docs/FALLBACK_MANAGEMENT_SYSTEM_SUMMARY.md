const PortfolioComponent = withFallback(MyPortfolioComponent, {
  serviceId: 'portfolio',
  retryable: true,
  showFallbackIndicator: true
});
```

#### Hook-Based Fallback
```jsx
import { useServiceFallback } from '@/components/common/FallbackIndicator';

const { data, loading, error, usingFallback } = useServiceFallback(
  'portfolio',
  () => apiClient.get('/api/portfolio/data'),
  [userId]
);
```

#### Manual Fallback Management
```jsx
import fallbackManager from '@/utils/fallbackManager';

// Register custom fallback provider
fallbackManager.registerFallback('custom_service', (context) => ({
  status: 'offline',
  data: generateCustomFallbackData(context),
  fallback: true
}));

// Get fallback data
const fallbackData = await fallbackManager.getFallbackData('custom_service', { userId });
```

### Next Steps
