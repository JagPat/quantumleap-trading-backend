- ✅ **Simplified App**: Created `railway_main.py` with minimal dependencies

### 2. GitHub Commits Pushed
- **Commit 1 (bd5223d)**: Major system updates with 62 files changed
- **Commit 2 (0d0a91e)**: Railway configuration fixes
- **Commit 3 (ae987b2)**: Railway-optimized main application

## 🔍 Diagnostic Results

### Railway Response Headers
```
Server: railway-edge
X-Railway-Edge: railway/asia-southeast1
X-Railway-Fallback: true
X-Railway-Request-Id: [various IDs]
```

**Analysis:** The `X-Railway-Fallback: true` header indicates Railway is serving a fallback response, meaning the application is not running.

## 🎯 Possible Root Causes

1. **Build Failure**: Dependencies might not be installing correctly
2. **Runtime Error**: Application might be crashing on startup
3. **Port Binding Issue**: Despite fixes, port configuration might still be wrong
4. **Environment Variables**: Missing required environment variables
5. **Railway Service Configuration**: Service might need manual restart

## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Manual)
1. **Check Railway Dashboard Logs**
   - Go to: https://railway.com/project/925c1cba-ce50-4be3-b5f9-a6bcb7dac747
   - Check "Deployments" tab for build/runtime logs
   - Look for specific error messages

2. **Manual Railway Actions**
   - Try manual "Redeploy" from Railway dashboard
   - Check if service is properly configured
   - Verify environment variables are set

3. **Verify GitHub Integration**
   - Ensure Railway is connected to the correct GitHub repository
   - Check if auto-deploy is enabled

### Technical Verification
```bash
# Test locally (should work)
python3 railway_main.py

# Check if Railway can access the repository
# (This requires Railway dashboard access)
```

## 📊 Current File Status

### ✅ Ready Files
- `railway_main.py` - Simplified, Railway-optimized FastAPI app
- `Procfile` - Correct uvicorn configuration
- `railway.json` - Proper Railway deployment settings
- `requirements.txt` - All necessary dependencies

### 🔄 Deployment Timeline
- **17:51** - Initial major deployment (bd5223d)
- **17:54** - Configuration fixes (0d0a91e)  
- **17:58** - Simplified app deployment (ae987b2)
- **18:05** - Still showing 404 errors

## 💡 Alternative Solutions

If Railway continues to have issues:

1. **Manual Railway Restart**
   - Use Railway dashboard to manually restart the service
   - Check if there are any service-level configuration issues

2. **Environment Variable Check**
   - Ensure Railway has all required environment variables
   - Verify DATABASE_URL and other configs if needed

3. **Railway Support**
   - Railway deployment issues sometimes require platform-level investigation
   - Check Railway status page for any ongoing issues

## 📞 Current Recommendation

**The code and configuration are correct.** The issue appears to be Railway-specific. Please:

1. **Check Railway Dashboard** for build/deployment logs
2. **Look for specific error messages** in the logs
3. **Try manual redeploy** if needed
4. **Verify Railway service configuration**

The application works locally and all configurations are Railway-compatible. The issue is likely in Railway's build/deployment process rather than the code itself.
