# Trading Engine Import Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

The Trading Engine page was failing to load with the following error:
```
Failed to resolve import "./apiClient" from "src/services/tradingEngineService.js". Does the file exist?
```

## ✅ **Root Cause**

The `tradingEngineService.js` file was trying to import `railwayAPI` from `./apiClient`, but:
1. There is no `apiClient.js` file in the `src/services/` directory
2. The correct import path for `railwayAPI` is `@/api/railwayAPI`

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**

**Before:**
```javascript
import { railwayAPI } from './apiClient';
```

**After:**
```javascript
import { railwayAPI } from '@/api/railwayAPI';
```

## ✅ **Verification**

The fix aligns with how other services import the API client:
- `aiService.js` uses: `import { railwayAPI } from '@/api/railwayAPI';`
- `railwayAPI` is properly exported from `@/api/railwayAPI.js`

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After this fix:
1. ✅ Trading Engine page should load without import errors
2. ✅ Trading Engine service should be able to make API calls
3. ✅ Status dashboard should display properly
4. ✅ All trading engine functionality should work

## 📱 **Testing**

To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to `/trading-engine` in the frontend
2. Check that the page loads without console errors
3. Verify that the status dashboard displays system information
4. Check browser network tab for successful API calls to `/api/trading-engine/health`

The trading engine infrastructure is now properly connected and should work as expected!
