## üîß Critical Fix Applied

### Problem Identified
The AI routes module existed in the codebase but was **never registered** with the Express app, causing all `/api/ai/*` endpoints to return **404 Route not found**.

### Fix Implemented
**File**: `server-modular.js`

**Added**:
```javascript
// Line 24: Import AI routes
const aiRoutes = require('./modules/ai/routes');

// Lines 102-103: Register AI routes
app.use('/api/ai', aiRoutes);
console.log('ü§ñ [AI] AI routes registered at /api/ai/*');
```

### Impact
- ‚úÖ `/api/ai/validate-key` endpoint now accessible
- ‚úÖ `/api/ai/preferences` (GET/POST) now accessible  
- ‚úÖ All AI module endpoints now functional
- ‚úÖ AI API key validation will work in frontend
