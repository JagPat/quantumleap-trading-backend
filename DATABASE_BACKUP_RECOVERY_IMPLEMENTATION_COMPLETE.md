## Usage Examples

### Basic Backup Operations
```python
# Initialize backup system
backup_system = BackupRecoverySystem("trading.db", "backups/")

# Create a full backup
backup_metadata = backup_system.create_full_backup()
print(f"Backup created: {backup_metadata.backup_id}")

# List all backups
backups = backup_system.list_backups()
for backup in backups:
    print(f"Backup: {backup['backup_id']} - {backup['status']}")

# Restore from backup
success = backup_system.restore_from_backup(backup_id)
```

### Disaster Recovery
```python
# Initialize disaster recovery
disaster_recovery = DisasterRecoveryManager(backup_system)

# Assess database health
health = disaster_recovery.assess_database_health()
if health['recovery_needed']:
    # Initiate automated recovery
    success = disaster_recovery.initiate_disaster_recovery()
```

### Point-in-Time Recovery
```python
# Recover to a specific point in time
target_time = datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=2)
recovered_backup_id = backup_system.point_in_time_recovery(target_time)
```
