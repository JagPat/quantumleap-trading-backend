# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## 🔧 Issues Fixed
- Fixed PORT environment variable parsing error
- Updated Dockerfile to use proper start script
- Added Railway-safe port handling in main.py
- Updated railway.toml configuration

## 📁 Files Modified
- `Dockerfile` - Updated with Railway-optimized configuration
- `main.py` - Added safe port parsing and Railway environment info
- `railway.toml` - Simplified configuration for Railway
- `start.sh` - New start script for proper Railway deployment

## 🚀 Deployment Process
1. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile
2. The start.sh script will handle PORT environment variable properly
3. Application will start with uvicorn using the correct port

## 🧪 Testing
After deployment, test these endpoints:
- GET / - Root endpoint with environment info
- GET /health - Health check endpoint
- GET /api/database/performance - Database performance metrics

## 📊 Expected Behavior
- Application should start without PORT parsing errors
- Health checks should pass
- All API endpoints should be accessible
