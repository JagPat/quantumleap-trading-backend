## Changes Made

### 1. Test User Creation

- Creates test user: test@quantumleap.com / test123
- Enables authentication testing

### 2. Missing Endpoints
- Added `/api/trading/status` endpoint
- Returns trading system status information

### 3. HTTP Method Routing
- Fixed POST method routing for auth endpoints
- Fixed POST method routing for AI endpoints
- Ensures proper HTTP method handling

### 4. Database Initialization
- Added `scripts/init_database.py`
- Initializes database with test data
- Can be run in production for testing setup

## Testing

```

Expected results:
