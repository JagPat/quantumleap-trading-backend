## 🎯 **Features Implemented**

### **Real Trading Engine Functionality:**
- ✅ **Signal Processing** - Complete signal → order → position workflow
- ✅ **Live Metrics** - Real-time tracking of orders, signals, strategies
- ✅ **Dynamic Alerts** - Create, track, and resolve system alerts
- ✅ **Event Coordination** - Async event processing with worker queues
- ✅ **State Management** - Track orders, positions, strategies in real-time
- ✅ **Risk Monitoring** - Risk alerts and emergency procedures
- ✅ **Health Checking** - Comprehensive component health monitoring
- ✅ **Configuration** - Dynamic system configuration management

### **Event-Driven Architecture:**
```
Signal Received → Order Created → Order Executed → Position Opened
     ↓               ↓              ↓                ↓
Risk Check → Order Validation → Execution → Position Monitoring
     ↓               ↓              ↓                ↓
Alerts → Coordination → State Update → Metrics Recording
```

### **Router Priority System:**
1. **Production Router** ← **NEW** (full features, no external deps)
2. **Full Router** (complex features, external deps)
3. **Simple Router** (basic functionality)
4. **Minimal Fallback** (emergency mode)
