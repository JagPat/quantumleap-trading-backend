# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend application is currently experiencing connection issues with the Railway-deployed backend. The errors indicate incorrect API endpoints, WebSocket connection failures, and missing page routes. This spec addresses the critical integration issues to ensure seamless frontend-backend communication. Additionally, it requires removing unnecessary frontend code and legacy components, conducting a deep review of existing frontend architecture to align with current development standards, and eliminating duplicate code to improve maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Endpoint Configuration Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend to connect to the correct Railway backend URL so that all API calls work properly and errors are eliminated through proper configuration and code cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the Railway backend URL `https://web-production-de0bc.up.railway.app`
2. WHEN the frontend is in development mode THEN it SHALL NOT attempt to connect to `localhost:8000`
3. IF the backend URL is not configured THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper CORS headers
5. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL show appropriate fallback states
6. WHEN backend code changes are made THEN they SHALL be deployed to the GitHub repository for automatic Railway deployment
7. WHEN Railway deployment completes THEN all endpoints SHALL be verified before proceeding to frontend testing

### Requirement 2: WebSocket Connection Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time features to work without WebSocket connection errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL NOT attempt to connect to `ws://localhost:5174`
2. IF WebSocket connections are needed THEN they SHALL use the correct Railway WebSocket URL
3. WHEN WebSocket connections fail THEN the application SHALL gracefully degrade to polling
4. WHEN real-time features are unavailable THEN users SHALL be notified appropriately

### Requirement 3: Trading Engine Page Route Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the Trading Engine page without getting "Page Not Found" errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to `/trading` THEN the Trading Engine page SHALL load successfully
2. WHEN I click on "Trading Engine" in the sidebar THEN the page SHALL display market data
3. IF the Trading Engine page fails to load THEN it SHALL show a meaningful error message
4. WHEN the page loads THEN it SHALL attempt to fetch data from the correct backend endpoints

### Requirement 4: User Profile Service Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile data to load from the correct backend endpoint and persist authentication credentials so that I don't need to re-authenticate with Kite and AI engines on each login.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user profile loads THEN it SHALL call the Railway backend API
2. WHEN the profile API is unavailable THEN it SHALL show appropriate fallback content
3. IF the user profile fails to load THEN it SHALL NOT break other application features
4. WHEN profile data is missing THEN the application SHALL provide default values
5. WHEN user authenticates with Kite THEN credentials SHALL be stored persistently
6. WHEN user configures AI engine settings THEN they SHALL be saved and restored on subsequent logins

### Requirement 5: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration so the frontend connects to the right backend in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN the frontend SHALL connect to the Railway backend
2. WHEN environment variables are set THEN they SHALL override default configurations
3. IF no backend URL is configured THEN the system SHALL use Railway as the default
4. WHEN switching environments THEN the API base URL SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work gracefully even when some backend services are unavailable, with clear indication when fallback mechanisms are being used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the application SHALL show user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN backend services are down THEN the frontend SHALL display fallback content
3. IF critical services fail THEN users SHALL be able to continue using available features
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged for debugging purposes
5. WHEN fallback mechanisms are active THEN users SHALL be clearly notified with visible indicators
6. IF the system switches to fallback mode THEN it SHALL attempt to reconnect to primary services periodically

### Requirement 7: CORS and Network Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want all API calls to work without CORS or network errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN CORS headers SHALL be properly configured
2. WHEN the backend responds THEN it SHALL include appropriate CORS headers
3. IF CORS errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 8: Page Routing Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want all navigation links to work and load the correct pages without errors, with proper integration to backend endpoints where available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click any sidebar navigation item THEN the corresponding page SHALL load
2. WHEN I navigate to any valid route THEN it SHALL display the correct content
3. IF a route doesn't exist THEN it SHALL show a proper 404 page with navigation options
4. WHEN pages load THEN they SHALL not show "Page Not Found" for valid routes
