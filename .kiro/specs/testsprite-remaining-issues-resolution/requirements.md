# TestSprite Remaining Issues Resolution Requirements

## Introduction

Following our successful TestSprite validation that improved our success rate from 27% to 53% (8/15 tests passing), we need to address the remaining 7 failing tests to achieve 100% test success. These failures are primarily related to OAuth integration, AI Chat accessibility, PWA functionality, security validation, and cross-browser compatibility.

The current failing tests are:
- TC001: OAuth2 Login and JWT Session
- TC007: AI Chat Interface Functional Interaction  
- TC009: Mobile Offline Support and PWA Functionality
- TC010: Accessibility Compliance Verification
- TC013: Security Validation: Session and Credential Protection
- TC014: Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing
- TC015: Load and Stress Testing for Concurrent Users

2. WHEN the system is under load THEN authentication and core features SHALL continue to function
3. WHEN stress testing is performed THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle resource constraints
4. WHEN concurrent users are simulated THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and session isolation
5. WHEN load and stress testing is performed THEN the system SHALL pass TC015 TestSprite validation

### Requirement 8: OAuth Fallback and Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust OAuth fallback system so that testing can continue even when live Kite Connect credentials are not available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN live OAuth credentials are not available THEN the system SHALL automatically use mock authentication
2. WHEN mock authentication is active THEN it SHALL simulate the complete OAuth flow including token exchange
3. WHEN switching between live and mock OAuth THEN the system SHALL handle the transition seamlessly
