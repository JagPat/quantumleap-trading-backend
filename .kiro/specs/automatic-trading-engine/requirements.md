# Automatic Trading Engine - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Automatic Trading Engine is the final critical component needed to transform QuantumLeap from an AI advisory platform into a fully automated trading system. This feature will connect the existing AI signal generation system to live order execution, enabling users to deploy trading strategies that operate without manual intervention.

Currently, the platform generates sophisticated AI-powered trading signals but requires manual execution. This requirement addresses the 10% gap needed to achieve full automation while maintaining robust risk management and user control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Order Execution System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want my approved trading strategies to automatically execute buy and sell orders based on AI-generated signals, so that I can benefit from algorithmic trading without manual intervention.

2. WHEN placing an automatic order THEN the system SHALL validate against all risk management rules before execution
3. WHEN an order is placed THEN the system SHALL log the execution details and update portfolio tracking in real-time
4. IF an order fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and alert the user after 3 failed attempts
5. WHEN market conditions change significantly THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate pending orders and cancel if necessary

### Requirement 2: Strategy Deployment and Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to deploy AI-generated trading strategies for automatic execution, so that my portfolio can be managed according to sophisticated algorithms without constant monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user activates a trading strategy THEN the system SHALL begin monitoring market conditions and executing trades according to strategy rules
2. WHEN a strategy is deployed THEN the system SHALL enforce position sizing, stop-loss, and take-profit rules automatically

### Requirement 4: Order Management and Tracking

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive tracking of all automated orders and executions, so that I can monitor my trading activity and performance in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order is placed THEN the system SHALL record order details, timestamp, and associated strategy
2. WHEN an order is filled THEN the system SHALL update position tracking and calculate realized P&L
3. WHEN viewing order history THEN the system SHALL display order status, fill price, and execution time
4. IF an order is partially filled THEN the system SHALL track remaining quantity and manage accordingly
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include all automated trading activity with performance metrics

### Requirement 5: User Control and Override System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the ability to override or pause automated trading at any time, so that I maintain ultimate control over my trading account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Emergency Stop" THEN the system SHALL immediately cancel all pending orders and pause all strategies

5. WHEN resuming automated trading THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate all positions and strategies before continuing

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring and Alerts

**User Story:** As a trader, I want real-time monitoring of my automated trading performance with intelligent alerts, so that I can stay informed about my portfolio's activity and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strategy performance deviates significantly from backtested results THEN the system SHALL alert the user
2. WHEN daily P&L exceeds Â±5% THEN the system SHALL send immediate notification to the user
3. WHEN a position approaches stop-loss level THEN the system SHALL send early warning alert
4. IF internet connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue orders and execute when connection is restored
5. WHEN generating daily reports THEN the system SHALL include automated trading summary and key metrics

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing AI Systems

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the automatic execution engine to seamlessly integrate with existing AI signal generation and portfolio analysis, so that all platform features work together cohesively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generates a trading signal THEN the execution engine SHALL receive and process it within 1 second

4. IF AI provider fails THEN the system SHALL use fallback provider without interrupting automated trading
5. WHEN user preferences change THEN all automated systems SHALL adapt to new settings immediately

### Requirement 8: Compliance and Audit Trail

**User Story:** As a trader, I want complete audit trails of all automated trading decisions and executions, so that I can review trading activity and ensure compliance with regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria
