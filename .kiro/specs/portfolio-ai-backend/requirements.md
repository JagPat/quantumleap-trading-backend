5. WHEN external data sources are available THEN the system SHALL integrate relevant market indicators

### Requirement 7: Scalable Analysis Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a scalable analysis architecture so that the system can handle multiple concurrent portfolio analyses efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple analysis requests occur THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently without performance degradation
2. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL implement proper queuing and rate limiting
3. WHEN analysis results are generated THEN the system SHALL cache results to improve response times
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL use efficient queries and connection pooling
5. WHEN error handling is needed THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation and meaningful error messages

### Requirement 8: Analysis Result Storage and Retrieval

**User Story:** As a user, I want analysis results to be stored and retrievable so that I can track portfolio analysis history and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL store results with timestamps and metadata
2. WHEN historical analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve previous analysis results efficiently
3. WHEN analysis trends are needed THEN the system SHALL provide comparison capabilities across time periods
4. WHEN data retention is managed THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data lifecycle policies
5. WHEN user data is accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper authorization and data privacy
