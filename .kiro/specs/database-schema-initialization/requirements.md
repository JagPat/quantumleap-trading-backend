# Database Schema Initialization Requirements

## Introduction

Based on the Railway backend logs, we have critical missing database tables (`users`, `portfolio_snapshots`) that are causing runtime errors despite having a comprehensive database optimization system already implemented. This spec addresses the gap between the existing database optimization infrastructure and the actual database schema initialization on Railway deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend system, I need properly initialized database tables so that user data can be stored and retrieved successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create all required database tables if they don't exist
2. WHEN a user registration occurs THEN the system SHALL successfully store user data in the `users` table
3. WHEN user credentials are requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve them from the `users` table without errors
4. IF database tables are missing THEN the system SHALL automatically initialize the schema

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio service, I need the portfolio_snapshots table to exist so that I can store and retrieve user portfolio data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN portfolio data is requested THEN the system SHALL query the `portfolio_snapshots` table successfully
2. WHEN portfolio snapshots are created THEN the system SHALL store them in the `portfolio_snapshots` table
3. WHEN retrieving latest portfolio data THEN the system SHALL return data without database errors
4. IF the portfolio_snapshots table is missing THEN the system SHALL create it with proper schema

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trading system, I need all trading-related endpoints to be properly configured so that trading functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `/api/trading/status` is accessed THEN the system SHALL return a valid response (not 404)
2. WHEN trading metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide accurate data
3. WHEN trading operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle them without routing errors
4. IF trading endpoints are missing THEN the system SHALL implement them with proper routing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI service consumer, I need all AI endpoints to have proper authentication and authorization so that protected resources are accessible to authorized users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing `/api/ai/strategy-templates` THEN authorized users SHALL receive data (not 403 Forbidden)
2. WHEN accessing `/api/ai/risk-metrics` THEN authorized users SHALL receive risk data
3. WHEN AI services check permissions THEN the system SHALL properly validate user authorization
4. IF permission checks fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I need database initialization to be automated so that deployments work consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application deploys to Railway THEN the database schema SHALL be automatically initialized
2. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL apply them automatically
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all required tables SHALL exist and be properly structured
4. IF database initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log clear error messages and retry

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I need proper error handling and logging so that database issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN tables are missing THEN the system SHALL attempt to create them and log the results
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error responses
4. IF database connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
