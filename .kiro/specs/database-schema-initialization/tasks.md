# Implementation Plan

Based on the existing database optimization spec (which is largely complete), this plan focuses only on the missing pieces needed to fix the Railway deployment issues.

- [x] 1. Fix missing database table initialization on Railway startup
  - Integrate existing database optimization system with Railway deployment startup
  - Ensure users and portfolio_snapshots tables are created automatically on app start
  - Update existing database manager to handle missing table scenarios gracefully
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Implement missing `/api/trading/status` endpoint
  - Add the missing trading status endpoint that's returning 404
  - Integrate with existing trading engine monitoring from database optimization spec
  - Ensure proper routing and HTTP method handling
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Fix AI endpoint authentication issues
  - Resolve 403 Forbidden errors on `/api/ai/strategy-templates` and `/api/ai/risk-metrics`
  - Update existing authentication system to properly handle AI endpoint permissions
  - Ensure user authorization checks work correctly for protected AI resources
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Fix broker session endpoint HTTP method handling
  - Resolve 405 Method Not Allowed error on `/api/broker/session?user_id=test_user`
  - Update routing to handle GET requests properly for broker session endpoint
  - Integrate with existing broker authentication system
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [-] 5. Deploy and validate Railway fixes
  - Deploy the minimal fixes to Railway platform
  - Validate that all database tables are created successfully on startup
  - Test all previously failing API endpoints to ensure they work correctly
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
