# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QuantumLeap trading backend is experiencing critical stability issues during startup that prevent core functionality from working properly. The system is falling back to minimal implementations for both AI analysis and trading engine components, which significantly reduces the application's capabilities. This feature addresses these stability issues to ensure reliable backend operation and full feature availability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to start without syntax errors, so that all AI analysis features are available to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN the analysis router SHALL load without syntax errors
2. WHEN the analysis router loads THEN all portfolio AI analysis endpoints SHALL be accessible
3. IF there are syntax errors in the analysis router THEN the system SHALL log specific error details for debugging
4. WHEN the analysis router is fixed THEN fallback analysis router SHALL not be needed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper logging infrastructure in place, so that trading engine components can start successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN the logs directory SHALL exist
2. WHEN trading engine routers initialize THEN required log files SHALL be accessible
3. IF log files are missing THEN the system SHALL create them automatically
4. WHEN logging infrastructure is proper THEN trading engine routers SHALL load without file system errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling during router initialization, so that individual component failures don't crash the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a router fails to load THEN the system SHALL continue startup with other routers
2. WHEN router loading fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN fallback routers are used THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which components are in fallback mode
4. IF critical routers fail THEN the system SHALL still provide basic functionality through fallbacks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all trading engine features to be available, so that I can access full trading functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN production trading engine router SHALL load successfully
2. WHEN trading engine is available THEN all trading endpoints SHALL respond correctly
3. IF production trading engine fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to load alternative implementations
4. WHEN trading engine is stable THEN minimal fallback router SHALL not be needed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive startup monitoring, so that I can quickly identify and resolve backend issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN startup progress SHALL be clearly logged
2. WHEN components load successfully THEN success indicators SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN components fail to load THEN failure reasons SHALL be logged with context
4. WHEN startup completes THEN a summary of loaded vs fallback components SHALL be provided
