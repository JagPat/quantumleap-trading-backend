# CORS Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The frontend is experiencing persistent CORS preflight failures with 400 status codes, preventing all API calls from working. While curl tests show 200 responses, browsers are getting 400 errors for OPTIONS requests, indicating a mismatch between server CORS configuration and browser preflight requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend CORS Configuration

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want all CORS preflight requests to succeed, so that the application can make API calls without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a browser sends an OPTIONS preflight request THEN the server SHALL respond with 200 status
2. WHEN the preflight includes standard headers THEN the server SHALL accept all required headers
3. WHEN the Origin is localhost:5173 THEN the server SHALL allow the request
4. IF the preflight request includes Authorization header THEN the server SHALL allow it
5. WHEN multiple API endpoints are accessed THEN all SHALL have consistent CORS behavior

### Requirement 2: Frontend Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle temporary network issues gracefully, so that I don't see constant error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CORS error occurs THEN the system SHALL retry the request automatically
2. WHEN retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL show a user-friendly error message
3. WHEN the backend becomes available THEN the system SHALL resume normal operation
4. IF authentication is required THEN the system SHALL include proper headers

### Requirement 3: Debugging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed logging of CORS issues, so that I can quickly identify and fix problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CORS error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN retries happen THEN the system SHALL log retry attempts
3. WHEN requests succeed THEN the system SHALL log success confirmation
4. IF backend health changes THEN the system SHALL log status updates
