# Kite Connect Portfolio Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refining the Kite Connect integration process and ensuring seamless portfolio data flow from Zerodha Kite to the Quantum Leap Trading Platform frontend. The integration uses the callback URL `https://web-production-de0bc.up.railway.app/broker/callback` configured in the Kite Connect developer portal.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: OAuth Flow Refinement

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with my Zerodha Kite account through a secure OAuth flow, so that I can access my portfolio data without sharing my login credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Connect with Kite" THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the Kite Connect OAuth URL with the correct API key
2. WHEN the user completes authentication on Kite THEN the system SHALL receive the request token at the configured callback URL
3. WHEN the callback is received THEN the system SHALL exchange the request token for an access token using the API secret
4. IF the token exchange is successful THEN the system SHALL store the user's Kite profile and authentication data
5. WHEN authentication is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect the user back to the dashboard with their portfolio loaded

### Requirement 2: Portfolio Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my Kite portfolio data to be automatically synchronized and displayed in the platform, so that I can view my holdings, positions, and performance metrics in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated with Kite THEN the system SHALL fetch their portfolio holdings from the Kite API
2. WHEN portfolio data is received THEN the system SHALL transform it into the platform's data format
3. WHEN portfolio data is processed THEN the system SHALL display holdings, positions, and P&L information
4. WHEN market hours are active THEN the system SHALL update portfolio values in real-time
5. IF portfolio sync fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and retry mechanism

### Requirement 3: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when Kite Connect integration fails, so that I can resolve issues and successfully connect my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with instructions to verify credentials
2. WHEN the Kite API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show a temporary error and provide a retry option
3. WHEN token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh the token or prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL cache the last known portfolio state and indicate offline mode
5. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 4: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want my Kite Connect credentials and portfolio data to be securely handled and protected, so that my financial information remains safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing API credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using industry-standard encryption
2. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for all API communications
3. WHEN storing access tokens THEN the system SHALL implement secure token storage with expiration handling
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored Kite credentials and tokens
5. WHEN handling portfolio data THEN the system SHALL comply with financial data protection standards

### Requirement 5: User Experience Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want a smooth and intuitive Kite Connect integration experience, so that I can quickly connect my account and start using the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the connection process THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions and visual feedback
2. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading states and progress indicators
3. WHEN connection is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message and automatically navigate to the dashboard
4. WHEN portfolio data is loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loaders and progress indicators
5. WHEN the user needs to reconnect THEN the system SHALL provide a simple reconnection flow

### Requirement 6: Portfolio Data Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my Kite portfolio data displayed in an organized and visually appealing format, so that I can easily understand my investment performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN portfolio data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display holdings with current values, P&L, and percentage changes
2. WHEN showing positions THEN the system SHALL differentiate between equity, F&O, and commodity positions
3. WHEN displaying performance THEN the system SHALL show day's P&L, overall P&L, and portfolio allocation charts
4. WHEN market data updates THEN the system SHALL reflect real-time price changes in the portfolio
5. WHEN portfolio is empty THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate empty state with guidance

### Requirement 7: Integration Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing of the Kite Connect integration, so that I can ensure reliability and catch issues before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL validate the complete OAuth flow
2. WHEN testing portfolio sync THEN the system SHALL verify data transformation and display accuracy
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL validate proper error handling and recovery
4. WHEN testing security THEN the system SHALL verify credential encryption and secure transmission
5. WHEN testing user experience THEN the system SHALL validate loading states and navigation flows
