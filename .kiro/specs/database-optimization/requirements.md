# Database Optimization and Migration Requirements

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the trading system's database performance, implementing proper indexing, query optimization, and ensuring data integrity for the production SQLite database (`sqlite:///production_trading.db`). The system needs to handle high-frequency trading data efficiently while maintaining ACID compliance and supporting concurrent operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a trading system administrator, I want optimized database performance, so that high-frequency trading operations can execute without latency issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes trading signals THEN database queries SHALL complete within 50ms for 95% of operations
2. WHEN concurrent users access portfolio data THEN the system SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent database connections
3. WHEN historical data is queried THEN complex analytical queries SHALL complete within 2 seconds
4. IF database size exceeds 1GB THEN the system SHALL maintain query performance through proper indexing
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2: Data Integrity and Consistency

**User Story:** As a trader, I want guaranteed data consistency, so that my portfolio calculations and trading decisions are based on accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trades are executed THEN all related database updates SHALL be atomic using transactions
2. WHEN portfolio calculations are performed THEN data consistency SHALL be maintained across all related tables
3. IF a database operation fails THEN the system SHALL rollback all related changes automatically
4. WHEN concurrent updates occur THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions using proper locking mechanisms
5. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the operation and log the error

### Requirement 3: Database Schema Migration and Versioning

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want automated database migrations, so that schema updates can be deployed safely without data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema changes are deployed THEN migrations SHALL execute automatically with rollback capability
2. WHEN database version conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prevent startup until resolved
3. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback to the previous schema version
4. WHEN new tables are added THEN existing data SHALL remain intact and accessible
5. WHEN columns are modified THEN data type conversions SHALL preserve existing information

### Requirement 4: Query Optimization and Indexing

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want optimized database queries, so that the system can handle high-volume trading operations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frequently accessed tables are queried THEN proper indexes SHALL be in place for optimal performance
2. WHEN complex joins are performed THEN query execution plans SHALL be optimized for minimal resource usage
3. IF slow queries are detected THEN the system SHALL log them for analysis and optimization
4. WHEN database statistics are outdated THEN the system SHALL automatically update them
5. WHEN query performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for optimization

### Requirement 5: Database Monitoring and Health Checks

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive database monitoring, so that I can proactively address performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations are performed THEN key metrics SHALL be collected and stored
2. WHEN database health degrades THEN alerts SHALL be triggered automatically
3. IF database connections are exhausted THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling
4. WHEN database size grows THEN automated cleanup procedures SHALL manage old data
5. WHEN backup operations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide automated backup functionality

### Requirement 6: Connection Management and Pooling

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want efficient database connection management, so that the system can scale to handle multiple concurrent users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN connection pooling SHALL optimize resource usage
2. WHEN idle connections exist THEN the system SHALL automatically close them after timeout
3. IF connection pool is exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests with appropriate timeouts
4. WHEN database reconnection is needed THEN the system SHALL handle it transparently
5. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns

### Requirement 7: Data Archival and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want automated data lifecycle management, so that database performance remains optimal as data volume grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN historical data exceeds retention policies THEN automated archival SHALL move old data
2. WHEN archived data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide access mechanisms
3. IF database size impacts performance THEN cleanup procedures SHALL remove unnecessary data
4. WHEN data compression is beneficial THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate compression
5. WHEN audit trails are required THEN data deletion SHALL maintain compliance records
