## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
python scripts/run_tests.py --type all --coverage

# Verify deployment
python scripts/deployment_verification.py --url https://web-production-de0bc.up.railway.app --report

# Check health endpoints
curl https://web-production-de0bc.up.railway.app/health
curl https://web-production-de0bc.up.railway.app/api/ai/monitoring/health/system

# Test AI functionality
curl -X POST https://web-production-de0bc.up.railway.app/api/ai/chat/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-User-ID: test_user" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, test message"}'
```
